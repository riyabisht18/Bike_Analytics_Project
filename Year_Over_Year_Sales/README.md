Project Overview
This analysis explores sales trends over multiple years, product performance, and customer segmentation to provide insights for business growth and strategic decisions.

Analysis Summary
Yearly Sales Trends
The peak sales year was 2013, generating nearly $16 million in revenue.

A sharp decline occurred in 2014, with sales dropping to approximately $45,642, despite a decrease in average prices. This suggests factors beyond pricing, such as market demand, discounts, and seasonality, significantly impact sales performance.

Running totals and moving averages were calculated to capture overall sales trends and highlight seasonal patterns.

Product Sales Performance
Products were analyzed yearly to compare current sales with their historical averages. Some showed growth, others declined, while a few remained stable year-over-year.

Bikes are the primary revenue drivers, accounting for around 96.46% of total sales.

The majority of products (approximately 110) are priced under $100, with a small subset (39 products) priced above $1000, indicating limited variety in high-value offerings.

Customer Segmentation Insights
Customers were classified into three groups based on purchase history and spending:

VIP: Customers active for 12+ months with spending over $5,000.

Regular: Customers active for 12+ months with spending up to $5,000.

New: Customers with less than 12 months of activity.

The largest segment consists of New customers (~14,631), reflecting strong customer acquisition.

The VIP segment is smaller (~1,655 customers), highlighting potential for loyalty programs and targeted marketing to increase high-value customers.
