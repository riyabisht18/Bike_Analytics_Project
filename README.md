## Overall Insights

###  Customer Base:  
Most customers are **new buyers**, with **VIP customers** contributing a large share of revenue but representing a smaller portion of the customer base. There is significant opportunity to nurture new and regular customers into VIPs through targeted engagement and loyalty programs.

###  Product Sales:  
**Bikes dominate sales revenue (~96%)**, while Accessories, Components, and Clothing have lower sales but present growth opportunities.

###  Pricing:  
Many products are priced below **`$100`**, limiting revenue potential. Only a few high-priced products drive significant sales.

### 📈 Sales Trends:  
Year-over-year sales fluctuate, influenced by factors beyond price, such as seasonality, promotions, and customer behavior.

###  Customer Behavior:  
New customers often become inactive after initial purchase, highlighting a need for retention strategies. Older customers tend to spend more and have longer lifespans.

### 🌍 Geographic Insights:  
USA leads in sales, followed by Australia, with other regions showing potential for growth. Some customer location data is missing, which needs addressing.

### ⏳ Product Lifecycle:  
Some top products haven’t sold recently, indicating seasonality or inventory issues. Longer product lifespan correlates with higher total sales.

### 🔗 Improve Cross-Selling & Upselling:

### 🛠️ Strengthen Customer Support & Services:  
- Provide 24/7 customer support, with on-demand technician visits for VIPs and loyal customers.  
- Introduce Proactive Service Notifications: Send reminders or calls to customers informing them of scheduled bike servicing.  
  Example message:  
  _“Dear [Customer Name], your bike service is scheduled for today. Our technician can visit you at your convenience, or you are welcome to visit our branch.”_
