Overall Insights
Customer Base:
Most customers are new buyers, with VIP customers contributing a large share of revenue but representing a smaller portion of the customer base. There is a significant opportunity to nurture new and regular customers into VIPs through targeted engagement and loyalty programs.

Product Sales:
Bikes dominate sales revenue (~96%), while Accessories, Components, and Clothing have lower sales but present potential growth opportunities.

Pricing:
Many products are priced below $100, which limits revenue potential. Only a few high-priced products drive significant sales.

Sales Trends:
Year-over-year sales show fluctuations influenced by factors beyond price, such as seasonality, promotions, and customer behavior.

Customer Behavior:
New customers often become inactive after their initial purchase, highlighting a need for improved retention strategies. Older customers tend to spend more and have longer customer lifespans.

Geographic Insights:
The USA leads in sales, followed by Australia, with other regions showing growth potential. Some customer location data is missing and requires attention.

Product Lifecycle:
Some top products have not sold recently, indicating seasonality or inventory challenges. A longer product lifespan correlates with higher total sales.

Suggested Improvements
Enhance Customer Loyalty Programs:

Incentivize converting new and regular customers into VIPs through discounts, free services, and exclusive perks.

Implement referral programs and personalized follow-ups to encourage repeat purchases.

Optimize Product Pricing & Promotions:

Review pricing on lower-cost products to improve margins without deterring buyers.

Use bundle offers (e.g., free tubes with tires, discounted accessories with bike purchases) to increase average order value.

Improve Cross-Selling & Upselling:

Promote accessories, components, and clothing as complementary products to bike purchases to boost sales in underperforming categories.

Address Data Gaps & Improve Segmentation:

Complete missing geographic data for better regional marketing.

Refine customer segmentation for more targeted marketing and support.

Manage Inventory & Product Lifecycle:

Monitor and address products with low or no recent sales through promotions, updates, or discontinuation.

Introduce new high-value products to diversify offerings.

Expand Regional Marketing:

Focus on emerging markets like Australia with localized marketing campaigns.

Strengthen Customer Support & Services:

Provide 24/7 customer support, including on-demand technician visits for VIPs and loyal customers.

Introduce proactive service notifications (calls or messages) reminding customers of bike servicing appointments, e.g.:

“Dear [Customer Name], your bike service is scheduled for today. Our technician can visit you at your convenience, or you are welcome to visit our branch.”
